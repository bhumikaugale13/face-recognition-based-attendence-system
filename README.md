Face Recognition Based Attendance System

📌 Project Description

The Face Recognition Based Attendance System is a smart attendance management application that uses face recognition technology to automatically mark student attendance. The system contains two dashboards:

Public Dashboard (Student Panel)

Students can register themselves, train the face recognition model, and mark attendance. However, attendance will only be recorded if the student is approved by the admin.
